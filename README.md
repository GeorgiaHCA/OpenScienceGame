# OpenScienceGame
A board game to teach and encourage people to use open science

This repository holds the working plans and outputs for the open science game team for the 2019 eLife Sprint. 

## Purpose

This game was created to be:

- Fun
  - We want to make a game that people actually enjoy! The core mechanic of the game should be fun enough to play for a non-scientist, however the details of narrative should provide extra amusement to those familiar with academia!
- Educational
  - The game aims to teach people about:
    - the value of doing science collaboratively 
    - the value of publishing in an Open fashion 
    - the importance of effective communication
    - the value of investing in learning tools to enable better science.
  - The game also aims to inform people about specific Open Science tools they could use in real life to help them do better Open Science!
- Simple
  - The game should be easy to pick up and start playing. It should require minimal set up and not be overcomplicated.
  - However, a simple set-up and rules should not be confused with simple strategy. The game should be sufficiently complex to engage the brain and provide ample opportunity for strategising.
