# Open Science: The Game

Open Science: The Game is a card game that was developed during the eLife Innovation Sprint 2019. The game intends to teach players about the benefits of Open Science. 

## Aim

The aim of the game is to **Achieve a Scientific Breakthrough**. In order to do that you must, collaboratively as a group, **Research** and **Disseminate** at least 5 **Insights**.

## Contents

The game consists of a series of cards and tokens.

## Set-up

- Shuffle the **Role** cards together to create the **Roles Deck**.
- Each **Player** chooses / is assigned a **Role** card from the **Roles Deck**.
- Seperate the **Starting Insight** cards from the **Ideas Deck**, and deal one to each player.
- **Event**, **Insight** and any remaining **Starting Insight** cards are shuffled together to form the **Ideas Deck**. 
- Deal 1 card to each player from the **Ideas Deck**. Then place the **Ideas Deck** face down on the playing table.

Setup is now complete, and each player should have 3 cards in their hand.

## Gameplay

A typical game round consists of the current **Player** using actions to gather and progress science. On their turn, a **Player** may take up to 2 **Actions** before handing over clockwise to the next player.

The game is won when 5 **Insights** have been **Disseminated**. If you reach the end of the **Ideas Deck** and no further **Actions** can be taken the game is lost.

In addition to the main shared objective, **Players** also have an additional, optionaly, objective to complete that is determined by their **Role** card. These 

## Action Types

During the game, a **Player** on their current turn may perform up to 2 **Actions** from the list below.
 **Ponder**: Draw a card from either the **Ideas Deck** or the **Tools Deck** and adds it to their **Hand**.
- **Research**: Turns an **Idea** card in their **Hand** into an **Output** by placing it in front of them on the table.
- **Disseminate**: **Player** places a **Open Access** or **Restricted Access** token onto one of their Research **Outputs**. Note that if you **Disseminate** an **Insight**, you MUST also draw and resolve a card from the **Impact Deck**.
- **Teach**: Gift a **Tool** card from their **Hand** to another player.

## Card Types

### **Idea**

**Ideas** can be **Researched** in order to produce **Outputs**. When an **Idea** has been **Researched** place it on the play area in front of you. There are 4 types of idea card listed below.
  - **Methods**
  - **Data Sets**
  - **Analysis**
  - **Insights**

Each **Idea** card may have a list of requirements that must be met before they can be **Researched**. For **Data Sets** this will typically entail **Access** to a particular **Method**. For **Insights** this will typically entail **Access** to a particular **Data Set** and a particular **Analysis**, and so on.

### **Tool**

**Tools** grant **Players** the ability to perform certain **Actions**, or reduce the cost of certain **Actions**.

### **Event** 

**Events** must be acted upon immediately when drawn and may be permanent or one-off and only affects the current player. Events can either be positive or negative, for example limiting a players ability to perform a specific action.

### **Impact**

When an **Insight** is **Disseminated**, the current player must draw a card from the top of the **Impact** deck, read the text aloud and then act on the text of the card imediately.

### **Roles**

Each **Role** has **Skills** and **Limitations** alongside a **Personal Objective**. Roles are used to vary gameplay by providing players with various different strengths. **Skills** typically allow a player to perform an **action** at a reduced cost.

# Glossary of Terms

### Restricting **Access**

When a player **Desiminates** a card they MUST choose if that card is **Open Access**, and hence available for all players to use, or if the card is **Restricted Access**, and hence only accessible exclusively to them. Tokens are placed on cards to denote the accessibility of the card, where a **Green Token** indicates a card is **Open Access**, and a **Red Token** indicates that a card is **Restricted Access**

### Open Access

An **Output** with **Open Access**, indicated by a **Green Token**, is freely accessibly to all players in the game.

### Restricted Access

An **Output** with **Restricted Access**, indicated by a **Red Token**, can ONLY be accessed by the player who **Desiminated** the card.

### Invalidating Cards

At points in the game, normally as a result of resolving an event card, a **Player** may be instructed to remove an **Output** from the game. To remove an **Output**, the **Player** should move the card of their choice to the **Idea Deck** discard pile, along with any other **Outputs** that depended on it.

### Impact Cards

During the game, whenever an **Insight** is **Desiminated** the current **Player** MUST draw and resolve 1 **Impact Card** from the **Impact Deck**. Impace cards can be either positive or negative, but unlike a standard **Event Card** affect the entire group.
