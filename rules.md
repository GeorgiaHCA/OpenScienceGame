# Open Science: The Game

Open Science: The Game is a card game that was developed during the eLife Innovation Sprint 2019. The game intends to teach players about the benefits of Open Science. 

## Aim

The aim of the game is to **Achieve a Scientific Breakthrough**. In order to do that you must, collaboratively as a group, **Research** and **Disseminate** at least 5 **Insights**.

## Contents

The game consists of a series of cards and tokens.

## Set-up

- Each **Player** chooses a **Role** card.
- Seperate the **Starting Idea** cards from the **Ideas Deck**, and deal two to each player.
- Shuffle the **Event** Card, remaining **Starting Ideas** and other **Ideas** together to form the **Ideas Deck**. 
- Place the **Ideas Deck** face down on the playing table.
- Suffle the **Tool** Cards, and place the top 3 cards face up on the playing table to form the **Tool Shop**.
- Place the rest of the **Tool** Cards face down on the playing table to form the **Tool Deck**.
- Place green **Open Access Tokens** and orange **Restricted Access Tokens** in a pile in the playing area.
- Choose which **Player** will go first. As a suggestion, perhaps who travelled the furthest to join.

Setup is now complete, and each player should have 2 cards in their hand.

## Gameplay

Players take it in turns. At the start of their turn, a **Player** must draw a card from the **Ideas Deck**. If they draw an **Event** it must be resolved immediately.  They can then take up to 2 additional **Actions** before handing over clockwise to the next player.

The **Group Objective** is to **Research** and **Disseminate** 5 **Insights**. If the **Players** accomplish this the game ends and the **Players** win. 

In addition to the **Group Objective**, **Players** also have an additional, **Personal Objective** to complete that is determined by their **Role** card. If the **Group Objective** is completed, Players who complete their **Personal Objective** get a **Personal Victory** in addition to the **Group Victory**. If the group objective is not completed all Players **lose**, even if they met their personal objective.

If the group **Run Out of Ideas** (i.e. a **Player** cannot draw a card from the **Ideas Deck** at the start of their turn) the game is lost.

## Action Types

During the game, a **Player** on their current turn may perform up to 2 **Actions**. The list of possible **Action Types** are given below. **Players** can choose to play 2 of the same **Action Type**.

- **Ponder**: Draw a card from the **Ideas Deck** add it to their **Hand**.
- **Research**: Turn an **Idea** card in their **Hand** into a **Research Output** by placing it in front of them on the table.
- **Disseminate**: **Player** places a **Open Access** or **Restricted Access** token onto one of their **Research Outputs**.
- **Learn**: Select a **Tool** from either your **Hand** or the **Tool Shop**, and place it under your **Role** Card such that you can see the effect. Each **Player** may only have 2 **Tools** active at any one time. If a **Player** with two active **Tools** chooses to **Learn** a new one, they must return one of the other active **Tools** to their **Hand**. It can then be **Relearned** at a later date.
- **Teach**: Select a **Tool** from either your **Hand** or your **Active Tools** to the **Active Tools** of another **Player**. 

## Card Types

### **Idea**

**Ideas** can be **Researched** in order to produce **Research Outputs**. When an **Idea** has been **Researched** place it on the play area in front of you. There are 4 types of idea card listed below.

  - **Experimental Methods**
  - **Data Sets**
  - **Analytical Methods**
  - **Insights**

Each **Idea** card may have a list of requirements that must be met before they can be **Researched**. For **Data Sets** this will typically entail **Access** to a particular **Method**. For **Insights** this will typically entail **Access** to a particular **Data Set** and a particular **Analysis**, and so on.

### **Tool**

**Tools** grant **Players** the ability to perform certain **Actions**, or reduce the cost of certain **Actions**.

### **Event** 

**Events** must be acted upon immediately when drawn and may be permanent or one-off and only affects the current player. Events can either be positive or negative, for example limiting a players ability to perform a specific action. **Global Events** affect all Players.

### **Roles**

Each **Role** has **Skills** and **Limitations** alongside a **Personal Objective**. Roles are used to vary gameplay by providing players with various different strengths. **Skills** typically allow a player to perform an **Action** at a reduced cost.

# Glossary of Terms

### Restricting **Access**

When a player **Desiminates** a card they MUST choose if that card is **Open Access**, and hence available for all players to use, or if the card is **Restricted Access**, and hence only accessible exclusively to them. Tokens are placed on cards to denote the accessibility of the card, where a green token indicates a card is **Open Access**, and an orange token indicates that a card is **Restricted Access**.

### Open Access

An **Output** with **Open Access**, indicated by a **Green Token**, is freely accessibly to all players in the game.

### Restricted Access

**Roles** and some permanent **Events** may indicate that a Player cannot access **Restricted Access Outputs**  indicated by a **Orange Token**.

### Retractions

If a Player is instructed to **Retract** a **Research Output** the **Player** should shuffle the card of their choice back into the **Idea Deck**, along with any other **Outputs** that depended on it.
