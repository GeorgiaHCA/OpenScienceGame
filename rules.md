Open Science: The Game is a card game that was developed during the eLife Innovation Sprint 2019. The game intends to teach players about the benefits of Open Science. 

## Aim

The aim of the game is to **Achieve a Scientific Breakthrough**. In order to do that you must, collaboratively as a group, **Research** and **Disseminate** at least 5 **Insights**.

## Contents

The game consists of a series of cards and tokens.

## Set-up

- Shuffle the **Role** cards together to create the **Roles Deck**.
- Each **Player** chooses / is assigned a **Role** card from the **Roles Deck**.
- Seperate the **Starting Insight** cards from the other **Idea** Cards, and deal one to each player.
- Deal 1 additional **Idea** card to each player then shuffle in the **Event** cards to form **Ideas Deck**.  
- Place the **Ideas Deck** face down on the playing table.

## Gameplay

A typical game round consists of the current **Player** using actions to gather and progress science. On their turn, a **Player** must Draw a Card from the **Ideas Deck** and may take up to 2 **Actions** before handing over clockwise to the next player.

The game is won when 5 **Insights** have been **Disseminated**. If a player cannot draw a card from the **Ideas Deck** at the start of their turn the game is lost.

In addition to the main shared objective, **Players** also have an additional, personal objective to complete that is determined by their **Role** card. If the group objective is completed, Players who complete their personal objective Double Win. If the group objective is not completed all Players lose, even if they met their personal objective.

## Action Types

During the game, a **Player** on their current turn may perform up to 2 **Actions** from the list below.

- **Ponder**: Draw a card from the **Ideas Deck** add it to their **Hand**.
- **Research**: Turns an **Idea** card in their **Hand** into an **Output** by placing it in front of them on the table.
- **Disseminate**: **Player** places a **Open Access** or **Restricted Access** token onto one of their Research **Outputs**.
- **Learn**: Select one of the Tools from your **Hand** or the three visable in the **Tool Shop** and place it under your **Role** Card such that you can see the effect.

For **Insights** this will typically entail **Access** to a particular **Data Set** and a particular **Analysis**, and so on.

# Glossary of Terms

### Restricting **Access**

When a player **Desiminates** a card they MUST choose if that card is **Open Access**, and hence available for all players to use, or if the card is **Restricted Access**, and hence only accessible exclusively to them. Tokens are placed on cards to denote the accessibility of the card, where a **Green Token** indicates a card is **Open Access**, and an **Orange Token** indicates that a card is **Restricted Access**

### Open Access

An **Output** with **Open Access**, indicated by a **Green Token**, is freely accessibly to all players in the game.

### Restricted Access

**Roles** and some permanent **Events** may indicate that a Player cannot access **Restricted Access Outputs**  indicated by a **Orange Token**.

### Retractions

If a Player is instructed to **Retract** a **Research Output** the **Player** should shuffle the card of their choice back into the **Idea Deck**, along with any other **Outputs** that depended on it.
