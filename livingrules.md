**GOAL**

Research the methods, datasets, and analyses needed to generate an insight from a set hypothesis.

**RULES**

Deck made up of research processes (Method, Datasets, and Analyses), events, and tools. All research process cards begin as inactive and must be 'researched' to make them playable. 'Researching' a card takes one turn and once activated in this way, they can be shared with the other players to give them access to that research process. Each player is assigned a character card with a specific set of attributes, some giving extra abilities to help reach the end goal. Event and tool cards are pulled randomly from the deck as play progresses. These cards affect the gameplay, with tools providing new skills to complete research tasks while event cards may have positive or negative impacts on the end goal. 

Each player starts with 1 hypothesis card and two actions per turn.

Player 1 has two actions. By default, their first move will be to draw a card from the deck. They can then either action that card or draw another.

Proceeding clockwise, each player will then take their two actions. 

To reach the end goal of generating an Insight, each player must have the Method, Dataset, and Analysis card specified on the original Hypothesis card.
