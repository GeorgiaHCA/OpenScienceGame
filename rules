## Aim

- Your aim is to **Achieve a Scientific Breakthrough**
- In order to do that you must, as a group, **Research** and **Disseminate** at least 5 **Insights**.

## Set-up

- Each **Player** chooses / is assigned a **Role** Card.
- **Tool**, **Event** and **Idea** Cards are shuffled together to form the **Deck**.

## Gameplay

- **Players** take it in turns.
- On your turn you may take up to 2 **Actions**
- Play proceeds clockwise.
- The game is won when 5 **Insights** have been **Disseminated**.
- If you reach the end of the **Deck** and no further **Actions** can be taken the game is lost.

## Action Types

- **Ponder**
  - **Player** draws a card from the **Deck** and adds it to their **Hand**.
- **Research**
  - **Player** turns an **Idea** Card in their **Hand** into an **Output** by placing it in front of them on the table.
- **Disseminate**
  - **Player** places an **Open** or **Restricted** **Access** token onto one of their Research **Outputs**.

## Card Types

- **Ideas**
  - Can be **Researched** in order to produce **Outputs**.
  - When an **Idea** has been **Researched** place it on the table in front of you.
  - **Ideas** come in 4 types
    - **Experimental Methods**
    - **Data Sets**
    - **Analytical Methods**
    - **Insights**
  - Each **Idea** will have a list of requirements that must be met before they can be **Researched**.
    - For **Data Sets** this will entail **Access** to a particular **Experimental Method**.
    - For **Insights** this will entail **Access** to a particular **Data Set** and a particular **Analtyical Method**.
- **Tools**
  - **Tools** grant **Players** the ability to perform certain **Actions** or reduce the cost of certain **Actions**.
  - Possible effects:
    - Grant ability to **Research** ONE OF **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
    - Researching ONE OF **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights** costs 1 less **Action**.
    - Grant ability to **Disseminate** ONE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights** in a **Restricted** fashion.
    - Grant ability to **Disseminate** ONE OF **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
    - Disseminating ONE OF **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights** costs 1 less Action.
    - Bonus: - Scihub grants **Access**  to **Restricted**  **Access**  pool.
- **Events** 
  - **Events** must be acted upon immediately when drawn and may be permanent or one-off.
  - Possible negative effects:
    - Restricting Actions
      - Players may no longer…
        - **Research** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
        - **Disseminate** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights** with **Open Access**.
        - **Disseminate** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
    - Invalidating Cards
      - Players may be ask to remove an **Output** from the game, along with any **Outputs** that depend on it.
    - Restricting **Access** 
      - Players may no longer **Access** any **Outputs** with **Restricted** **Access**.
- **Roles**
  - Each **Role** has **Skills** and **Limitations** and a **Personal Objective**
    - Possible **Skills**:
      - Can **Research** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
      - **Researching** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights** costs one less **Action**.
      - Can **Disseminate**
      - Can **Disseminate** with **Open Access**.
      - **Dissemination** costs one less **Action**.
      - Can transfer their **Tool** cards to other **Players** for 1 **Action**
      - Can transfer their **Idea** cards to other **Players** for 1 **Action**
    - Possible **Limitations**:
      - Can only **Disseminate** in a **Restricted**  fashion
      - Cannot **Disseminate** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
      - Cannot **Research** ONE OR MORE OF  **Experimental Methods** / **Data Sets** / **Analytical Methods** or **Insights**.
      - Cannot **Collaborate** (give / receive **Idea** cards from other **Players**).
    - Possible **Personal Objectives**:
      - Learn 5 Tools by the end of the game.
      - Be the player with the most **Research Outputs**.
      - Be the player with the most **Disseminated** **Research Outputs**.
      - Be the player with the most **Open Access Disseminated** **Research Outputs**.
      - Publish at least 2 **Insights** with Closed Access (High Impact Journals).

## Factors to Investigate

- Number of Decks
  - Split **Deck** into Ideas+**Events**  and Tools
    - Picking up a **Tool** is a separate **Action** type called **Learn**.
  - Split **Deck** into **Ideas**, **Events**  and Tools
    - Picking up a **Tool** is a separate **Action** type called **Learn**.
    - Pick up **Events**  based on die role?
- Restrictions on Actions
  - Should **Players** be able to do everything by default (except where restricted by Role / **Events** )?
  - Or Should **Players** be unable to do anything by default except what is explicitly granted by **Role** or **Tools**?
- Balance of Cards
  - Number of **Events**  / **Tools** / **Ideas** in the **Deck** necessary to make the game balance.
  - Should there be more than one of each **Idea**? i.e three Data Set A’s?
- Number of **Actions** per **Player**
